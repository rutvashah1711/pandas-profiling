# pandas-profiling
-->Pandas profiling is an open source Python module with which we can quickly do an exploratory data analysis with just a few lines of code. 
--> In short, what pandas profiling does is save us all the work of visualizing and understanding the distribution of each variable. 
--> Here Pandas profiling of the Iris dataset is done using google colab.
.
.
--> First we run the pandas profiling as shown in the code, by importing the dataset given here.
--> Then we run the code for creating the html file of it, which gives html file like it gave here.
    (which may not here, but running the code will help you generate the same file)
